## Book Library Project- Presentation Link:

This project required me to create an application that will use a CRUD Functionalty that will allow the user to manage a Book Library.

- Project Management Tools - Jira Kanban Board and Github.
- Databases - mySQL and H2 for testing.
- Backend Application - SpringBoot JAVA
- Front End - HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
- Testing - JUnit(Backend) PostMan(FrontEnd) H2(Database Intergration)


```
- The user will be able to create, update, delete, view all books in the system.
```

A JAVA backend application will react with a MySQL Database, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to create a fully functioning application that will do the following

```
- CREATE books
- VIEW all books
- UPDATE books
- DELETE books
```
