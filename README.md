This project required me to create an application that will use a CRUD Functionalty that will allow the user to manage a Book Library.

- Project Management Tools - Jira Kanban Board and Github.
- Databases - mySQL and H2 for testing.
- Backend Application - SpringBoot JAVA
- Front End - HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
- Testing - JUnit(Backend) PostMan(FrontEnd) H2(Database Intergration)


```
- The user will be able to create, update, delete, view all books in the system.
```

A JAVA backend application will react with a MySQL Database, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to create a fully functioning application that will do the following

```
- CREATE books
- VIEW all books
- UPDATE books
- DELETE books
```

## Application Planning Stages.

Project Management tool Jira was used to plan this project.

### Creation of DataBases

H2 and mySQL was used as databases.

H2 was used as a pseudo database to see if tables were created succesfully.

mySQL was used to create databases and command line interface was navigated to see if tables were created with data input.
